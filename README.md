# The Sinatra Skeleton app that hits all the right notes

Make your web voice known with [Sinatra][sinatra], save all your memories with [DataMapper][datamapper], manage your look and feel with [Sprockets][sprockets], and keep yourself looking [Slim][slim] while standing on a solid [Foundation][foundation]. This is one beautiful song!...

When you're singing that duet, keep things tuned with [Capybara][capybara], [Cucumber][cucumber], and some [RSpec][rspec].

But really, this is a Sinatra Skeleton app that leverages all of my favorite technology in one place. Feel free to fork, clone, and change as you wish.
